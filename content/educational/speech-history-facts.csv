1,The First Speech Synthesizer,"In 1779, Christian Kratzenstein built one of the first speech synthesizers - a set of resonating tubes that could produce vowel sounds when air was blown through them. It was remarkably accurate for its time!",🔗 More: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis#History,Technology
2,The Discovery of Formants,"In the 1950s, researchers discovered that vowels could be characterized by their formant frequencies - specific resonances in the vocal tract. This insight revolutionized both speech science and synthesis.",📚 Key paper: Potter et al. (1947) 'Visible Speech',Discovery
3,The Peterson-Barney Study,"The Peterson & Barney (1952) study measured formant frequencies from 76 speakers. Their vowel charts are STILL used today to teach phonetics, over 70 years later!",📊 Original study: Peterson & Barney JASA 1952,Methods
4,The Birth of the Spectrogram,"During WWII, engineers at Bell Labs developed the sound spectrograph to analyze encrypted speech. After the war, it became the speech scientist's most important tool for visualizing sound.",🎙️ Learn more: antiqueradio.org/soundspec.htm,Technology
5,McGurk Effect Discovery,"In 1976, Harry McGurk discovered that what we SEE affects what we HEAR. When watching someone say 'ga' while hearing 'ba', most people perceive 'da'. Vision and hearing integrate automatically!",🎥 Watch it: youtube.com/watch?v=G-lN8vWm3m0,Perception
6,The Source-Filter Theory,"Gunnar Fant's source-filter theory (1960) explained how speech is produced: a sound source (vocal folds) filtered by the vocal tract shape. This model is still the foundation of speech science today!",📖 Reference: Fant's Acoustic Theory of Speech Production,Theory
7,Coarticulation Discovery,"Researchers discovered that we don't produce speech sounds in isolation - each sound is influenced by neighboring sounds. This 'coarticulation' makes speech production efficient but recognition challenging!",🔬 Key insight for speech perception research,Production
8,The Cocktail Party Effect,"Colin Cherry (1953) described how we can focus on one conversation in a noisy room full of people talking. This launched decades of research into selective attention and speech perception.",🎧 Cherry (1953) - foundational auditory perception study,Perception
9,Voice Onset Time,"Researchers discovered that the difference between 'pa' and 'ba' is just timing - how long between lip opening and vocal fold vibration. VOT became crucial for understanding speech perception categories.",⏱️ Lisker & Abramson (1964) classic study,Phonetics
10,Mel Frequency Scale,"In the 1930s, Stevens and Volkmann showed that our perception of pitch isn't linear - the mel scale was born! This perceptual scale is now fundamental to speech processing and voice technology.",🎵 Foundation of modern speech recognition systems,Perception
