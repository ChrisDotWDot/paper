1,Acoustic Theory of Speech Production,Gunnar Fant,1971,7825,"This paper laid the foundation for how we understand speech production today. The source-filter model is still used in every voice synthesis system!",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Fant+Acoustic+Theory+Speech+Production,Production
2,The Motor Theory of Speech Perception,Liberman et al,1967,5765,"Proposed that speech perception involves motor simulation - we understand speech by mentally simulating how we would produce those sounds. Hugely influential!",https://haskinslabs.org/sites/default/files/files/Reprints/HL0069.pdf
3,A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models,L.R Rabiner & B.H. Juang,2003,7556,"Provided the statistical framework that revolutionized speech recognition. HMMs enabled the first practical large-vocabulary systems.",https://www.academia.edu/download/31037917/Rabiner1986_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models.pdf
4,Distinctive Features and Phonological Opposition,Roman Jakobson,1951,12000,"Established distinctive features as the building blocks of phonology. Influenced decades of linguistic theory and speech recognition systems.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Jakobson+Distinctive+Features,Phonology
5,Articulatory Phonology,Browman & Goldstein,1986,2800,"Introduced articulatory phonology as a dynamic approach. Rather than static positions speech involves coordinated gestural patterns - a paradigm shift!",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Browman+Goldstein+Articulatory+Phonology,Phonology
6,Speech Perception by the Human Brain,David Poeppel,2003,1800,"Integrated neuroscience with speech perception proposing dual processing streams in the brain. Changed how we think about neural basis of speech.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Poeppel+Speech+Perception+Brain,Neuroscience
7,Coarticulation in Connected Speech,Patricia Keating,1990,2100,"Systematically described how speech sounds overlap in natural speech. Essential for understanding fluent speech production vs isolated sounds.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Keating+Coarticulation,Production
8,A Mathematical Theory of Communication,Claude Shannon,1948,15000,"While not speech-specific Shannon's information theory provided the mathematical foundation for all digital communication including speech transmission.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6773024,Information
9,Categorical Perception of Speech Sounds,Alvin Liberman,1957,5200,"Introduced categorical perception - the idea that we perceive continuous acoustic signals as discrete phonetic categories. Revolutionized speech perception research.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Liberman+Categorical+Perception,Perception
10,Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling,Hinton et al.,2012,8000,"Showed that deep learning could dramatically improve speech recognition accuracy. Sparked the neural network revolution in speech technology.",https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Hinton+Deep+Neural+Networks+Speech,Technology
