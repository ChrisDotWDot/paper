1,Acoustic Theory of Speech Production,Gunnar Fant,1971,7825,"This paper laid the foundation for how we understand speech production today. The source-filter model is still used in every voice synthesis system!",https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qa-AUPdWg6sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA5&dq=Acoustic+Theory+of+Speech+Production+fant&ots=reqW0QF7xV&sig=Bm4BJlCziezHHkM2Trrewq1Tw9k
2,The Motor Theory of Speech Perception,Liberman et al,1967,5765,"Proposed that speech perception involves motor simulation - we understand speech by mentally simulating how we would produce those sounds. Hugely influential!",https://haskinslabs.org/sites/default/files/files/Reprints/HL0069.pdf
3,A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models,L.R Rabiner & B.H. Juang,2003,7556,"Provided the statistical framework that revolutionized speech recognition. HMMs enabled the first practical large-vocabulary systems.",https://www.academia.edu/download/31037917/Rabiner1986_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models.pdf
4,On linguistic aspects of translation, 1959,11012,"translator of what messages? betrayer of what values?",https://www.academia.edu/download/46861872/Jakobson_Roman_1959_On_Linguistic_Aspects_of_Translation.pdf
5,Articulatory Phonology,Browman & Goldstein,1992,2993,"Introduced articulatory phonology as a dynamic approach. Rather than static positions speech involves coordinated gestural patterns",https://sail.usc.edu/~lgoldste/General_Phonetics/Week3/Browman_Goldstein_1992.pdf
6,The cortical organization of speech processing,Hickok & Poeppel,2007,6971,"Integrated neuroscience with speech perception proposing dual processing streams in the brain.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2113
7,Phonetic and phonological representation of stop consonant voicing,Patricia Keating,1984,859,"Argued for a more structured view of the relation between the phonological feature [voice] and its specific phonetic implementations",https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/413642.pdf
8,A Mathematical Theory of Communication,Claude Shannon,1948,118152,"While not speech-specific Shannon's information theory provided the mathematical foundation for all digital communication including speech transmission.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6731005/6773023/06773024.pdf
9,The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phoneme boundaries,Liberman et al,1957,2637,"Introduced categorical perception - the idea that we perceive continuous acoustic signals as discrete phonetic categories. Revolutionized speech perception research.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nirmala-Svsg/post/How_would_you_compare_a_sound_sample_and_a_speech_sample_to_find_similarities_and_differences/attachment/59d6349a79197b8077992405/AS%3A380493318115329%401467728084647/download/liberman_etal_1957_jep.pdf
